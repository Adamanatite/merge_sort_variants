# Merge and Quicksorts
Java code for the quicksort algorithm and some variants, the merge sort algorithm, and methods for testing and timing the algorithms, as well as creating an array designed to make quick sort run slowly.

<b>Variants:</b>
  * <b>Quicksort:</b> The standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">quicksort</a> algorithm
    * <b>Hybrid sort:</b> A hybrid version of quicksort which switches to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort">insertion sort</a> for sufficiently small subarrays
    * <b>Median of 3 sort:</b> A version of quicksort which uses the "median of 3" partitioning scheme
    * <b>3-way sort:</b> A version of quicksort which also sorts equal elements to the partition, as described in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem">Dutch national flag problem</a>
  * <b>Merge sort:</b> The standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">merge sort</a> algorithm
